# TranquiL
Sometimes we just need to slow life down and take a break from this stressful world. A guided solution for stress management, Tranquil is an app that promotes anything peaceful. Users will complete an assessment to determine stress levels and will be provided with a video to correspond to helping them get to a better state of mind (i.e. yoga, mediation, and exercise).
